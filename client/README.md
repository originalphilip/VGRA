# Client for Video Game Review Aggregator

## Introduction
This client-side application is developed using React. It interfaces with the server to fetch and display video game reviews in an engaging and interactive format.

## Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (Download and install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/))
- npm (Comes installed with Node.js)

### Setup
Unzip the repository and navigate to the client directory:
cd client 

### Installation
Install all dependencies required by the project:
'npm install'

### Running the application
To start the client application in developmen mode:
'npm start'

This command will run the client at http://localhost:3000. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for production
When ready to build the production version of the app:
'npm run build'
This commande will build the application for production to the 'build' folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
